# Parallax Adventure Website

This project demonstrates a parallax effect using HTML and CSS. The parallax effect is achieved by layering images and text at different depths within a 3D space, giving the illusion of depth as the user scrolls through the page.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the content of the website.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the website and implements the parallax effect.
- **/img**: The directory containing all images used in the project.

## Key Features

- **Parallax Effect**: The website uses CSS properties like `perspective`, `translateZ`, and `background-attachment: fixed;` to create a layered scrolling effect that simulates depth.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Adventure Theme**: The content focuses on adventure activities like biking, paragliding, and surfing, with relevant images and text.
